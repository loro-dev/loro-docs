# Introduction to Loro

It is well-known that syncing data/building realtime collaborative apps is
challenging, especially when devices can be offline or part of a peer-to-peer
network. Loro simplifies this process for you.

We want to provide better DevTools to make building
[local-first apps](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) easy and
enjoyable. 

Loro uses [Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)](/docs/concepts/crdt) to
resolve parallel edits. By utilizing Loro's data types, your applications can be
made collaborative and keep the editing history with low overhead.

After you model your app state by Loro, syncing is simple:

```ts
const docA = new LoroDoc();
const docB = new LoroDoc();
docA.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello world!");
docB.getText("text").insert(0, "Hi!");
// Assume docA and docB are two Loro documents in two different devices
const bytesA = docA.export({ mode: "update" });
// send bytes to docB by any method
docB.import(bytesA);
// docB is now updated with all the changes from docA

const bytesB = docB.export({ mode: "update" });
// send bytes to docA by any method
docA.import(bytesB);
// docA and docB are now in sync, they have the same state
```

Saving your app state is also straightforward:

```ts
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.getText("text").insert(0, "Hello world!");
const bytes = doc.export({ mode: "snapshot" });
// Bytes can be saved to local storage, database, or sent over the network
```

Loading your app state:

```ts no_run
const newDoc = new LoroDoc();
newDoc.import(bytes);
```

Loro also makes it easy for you to time travel the history and add version
control to your app. [Learn more about time travel](/docs/tutorial/time_travel).

```ts no_run
doc.checkout(version); // Checkout the doc to the given version
```

Loro is compatible with the JSON schema. If you can model your app state with
JSON, you probably can sync your app with Loro. Because we need to adhere to the
JSON schema, using a number as a key in a Map is not permitted, and cyclic links
should be avoided.

```ts no_run
doc.toJSON(); // Get the JSON representation of the doc
```

- [1] Loro uses [a Peritext-like algorithm](/blog/loro-richtext) to merge the
  concurrent edits to rich text styles. It's different from the original design
  but it passes all the criteria listed in the paper.
- [2] Unlike others, Yjs requires users to store a version vector and a delete
  set, enabling time travel back to a specific point.
- [Fugue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00583) is a text/list CRDTs that can
  minimize the chance of the interleaving anomalies.
