# How to Use Time Travel in Loro

In Loro, you can call `doc.checkout(frontiers)` to jump to the version specified
by the
frontiers([Learn more about frontiers](/docs/advanced/version_deep_dive)).

Note that using `doc.checkout(frontiers)` to jump to a specific version places
the document in a detached state, preventing further edits. To learn more, see
[_Attached/Detached Status_](/docs/advanced/doc_state_and_oplog#attacheddetached-status).
To continue editing, reattach the document to the latest version using
`doc.attach()`. This design is temporary and will be phased out once we have a
more refined version control API in place.

Below is an example demonstrating Time Travel functionality.

    window.clarity?.("event", "play-time-travel");

    border: 0,
    borderRadius: 8,
    marginTop: 16,
    overflow: "hidden",
    filter: "invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)",
  }}
