# Counter

Loro's Counter will add up all the applied values, and supports integers and floating point numbers.

Here is how to use it:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
import { expect } from "expect";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
const counter = doc.getCounter("counter");
counter.increment(1);
counter.increment(2);
counter.decrement(1);
expect(counter.value).toBe(2);
```
