# Version

In centralized environments, we can use linear version numbers to represent a version, such as incrementing a number each time or using timestamps. However, CRDTs can be used in decentralized environments, and their version representation is different.

In Loro, you can express a document's version through a [Version Vector](/docs/concepts/version_vector) or [Frontiers](/docs/concepts/frontiers).

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";
// ---cut---
const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.version(); // State Version vector
doc.oplogVersion(); // OpLog Version vector
doc.frontiers(); // State Frontiers
doc.oplogFrontiers(); // OpLog Frontiers
```

In most cases, you might only need the Version Vector, which can be used for data synchronization and version comparison.
