# Undo

We provide an `UndoManager` that helps you manage the undo/redo stack and can be
used during concurrent editing. It also supports cursor position transformation.
In the case of concurrent editing, you will want the undo/redo to be **local**,
meaning it should only undo/redo local operations without affecting other
collaborators' edits.

### Why Local Undo/Redo?

If undo/redo is global, it often does not meet expectations. Consider the
following scenario:

- **User A and User B are collaborating**: They are likely editing different
  parts of the document.
- **User A performs an undo**: If this undoes User B's operations, User A might
  see no changes and think the undo failed, as User B might be editing content
  outside of User A's view.
- **User B's perspective**: User B would find their recent edits deleted without
  knowing how it happened.

## Usage

To create an `UndoManager`, you can specify:

- Which local operations are not recorded.
- The merge range for undo operations.
- The stack depth.

```ts no_run
const undoManager = new UndoManager(doc, {
    maxUndoSteps: 100, // default 100
    mergeInterval: 1000, // default 1000ms
    excludeOriginPrefixes: ["sys:"], // default []
    onPush: ...,
    onPop: ...
}));
```

## Limitations

It can only track a single peer. When the peer ID of the document changes, it will
clear the undo stack and the redo stack and track the new peer ID.

## Restoring Selections

When utilizing undo/redo functionalities, it is important for our application to
restore the selection to its position prior to the operation that is being
undone or redone. This task is particularly challenging in a collaborative
setting where remote operations can alter the cursor's position (for instance,
if the cursor needs to revert to the 5th position, but remote operations have
added new characters before this position).

<details>
<summary>Challenges</summary>

- **Local undo/redo**: Local undo and redo delete and recreate elements. If we
  use CRDT-based stable positions, they might lock on to the deleted elements,
  while the user's expectation is for the cursor to return to the newly created
  elements after redo.
- **Example**:
  ```
  A fox jumped
  ```
  - Select "fox" and delete it.
  - Undo.
  - After undo, the three characters "fox" should be recreated, and the cursor
    should select these three characters. However, if we use stable positions,
    it would lock onto the initially deleted characters, and after undo, the
    absolute positions obtained would be `start = 2` and `end = 2`.

</details>

### Solution

We support storing [`cursors`](/docs/tutorial/cursor) for each undo/redo action
within the `UndoManager`. The `UndoManager` will adjust the stored cursors to
reflect changes from remote edits or other undo/redo operations, ensuring they
match the current state of the document.

They need be handled by the `onPush` and `onPop` callbacks.

On `onPush`, you can return a list of `Cursor`s that you want to store. On
`onPop`, you can retrieve the stored cursors and use them to restore the
selection.

Typically, you may need to store selections in an undo/redo item in the
following cases:

- When a new local change is applied, we need to record a new undo item.
  Therefore, we must store the selection **before** the operation to be undone.
  - **Purpose**: Storing the selection **before** is crucial because we may lose
    the selection after applying the operation. If the user selects text and
    deletes it, after undo, the `onPop` can retrieve the state of the selected
    deleted content.
- **First undo operation**: Store the current document's selection for the
  corresponding redo item.
  - **Purpose**: After redo, it can return to the initial selection state.

Internally, we also automatically handle the storage and reset of cursors in the
undo/redo loop state.

```ts
const doc = new LoroDoc();
let cursors: Cursor[] = [];
let poppedCursors: Cursor[] = [];
const undo = new UndoManager(doc, {
  mergeInterval: 0,
  onPop: (isUndo, value, counterRange) => {
    poppedCursors = value.cursors;
  },
  onPush: () => {
    return { value: null, cursors: cursors };
  },
});

doc.getText("text").insert(0, "hello world");
doc.commit();
cursors = [
  doc.getText("text").getCursor(0)!,
  doc.getText("text").getCursor(5)!,
];
// delete "hello ", the cursors should be transformed
doc.getText("text").delete(0, 6);
doc.commit();
expect(poppedCursors.length).toBe(0);
undo.undo();
expect(poppedCursors.length).toBe(2);
expect(doc.toJSON()).toStrictEqual({
  text: "hello world",
});
// expect the cursors to be transformed back
expect(doc.getCursorPos(poppedCursors[0]).offset).toBe(0);
expect(doc.getCursorPos(poppedCursors[1]).offset).toBe(5);
```

<summary>Implementation</summary>

[The implementation of undo/redo](https://github.com/loro-dev/loro/pull/361)
follows a model similar to ProseMirror/Quill, which are based on OT (Operational
Transformation) algorithms (so we also implement basic OT primitives
internally).

When implementing undo/redo operations, we need to ensure the following
properties:

- Do not undo remote inserts.
- Redo after undo should return to the original state.
- If there is no concurrent editing, undo should return to the previous
  version's state.

Therefore, we have also added some relevant checks in our internal fuzzing tests
to ensure correctness.
