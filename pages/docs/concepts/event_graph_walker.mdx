# Event Graph Walker (Eg-Walker)

Event Graph Walker (Eg-Walker) is a revolutionary CRDT algorithm that fundamentally changes how collaborative editing systems handle concurrent operations. Instead of storing complex CRDT metadata, Eg-Walker enables the use of simple indices by efficiently replaying relevant history when needed.

## The Problem: Complex CRDT Metadata

Traditional CRDTs require extensive metadata to maintain consistency across distributed systems:

- **RGA algorithm**: Requires operation ID and Lamport timestamp of the left neighbor
- **Yjs/Fugue**: Needs operation IDs of both left and right neighbors
- **Storage overhead**: Each operation carries significant metadata for position tracking
- **Tombstone accumulation**: Deleted content must be retained indefinitely

This metadata complexity leads to:
- Increased storage requirements
- Slower performance as documents grow
- Complex garbage collection challenges
- Higher network bandwidth usage

## The Innovation: Simple Indices with Smart Replay

Eg-Walker introduces a paradigm shift: **record simple indices, replay when needed**.

  height={512}

### Core Concept

Instead of storing complex position descriptors, Eg-Walker:
1. Records operations with **simple indices** at the time of execution
2. Maintains a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the edit history
3. **Replays relevant portions** of history when merging concurrent changes
4. Reconstructs the exact CRDT state only when needed

## How It Works

### The Event Graph

In collaborative editing, parallel edits naturally form a directed acyclic graph (DAG), similar to Git's history:

```
    A --- B --- C     (User 1)
   /             \
Root              Merge
   \             /
    D --- E --- F     (User 2)
```

Each node represents an operation, and edges represent causal dependencies.

### The Algorithm

#### 1. **Local Operations: Direct and Fast**

When a user makes a local edit:
- Record the operation with its **current index position**
- No complex metadata calculation needed
- Immediate application to the document

Example:
```javascript
// Traditional CRDT (e.g., RGA)
insert({
  char: 'a',
  leftId: 'op-123',
  timestamp: 1234567890,
  siteId: 'user-1'
})

// With Eg-Walker
insert({
  char: 'a',
  index: 5  // Simple index!
})
```

#### 2. **Merging Remote Operations: Smart Replay**

When receiving remote operations:

1. **Find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** between local and remote versions
2. **Replay operations** from the LCA to both versions
3. **Construct temporary CRDT state** to calculate effects
4. **Apply the merged result**

The key insight: You only replay the **divergent portion** of history, not the entire document.

#### 3. **Index Transformation**

Consider this scenario:
- You highlight text from index 10 to 20
- Concurrently, someone inserts 5 characters at index 3
- Your highlight should shift to indices 15 to 25

Eg-Walker handles this by:
1. Identifying concurrent operations through the event graph
2. Replaying operations in causal order
3. Transforming indices based on the replay sequence

## Performance Benefits

### 1. **Reduced Storage**

| Aspect | Traditional CRDT | Eg-Walker |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| Per-operation metadata | 20-50 bytes | 4-8 bytes |
| Tombstone storage | Permanent | Can be garbage collected |
| Document growth | Linear with all operations | Linear with active operations |

### 2. **Faster Local Updates**

- **No metadata computation**: Direct index-based operations
- **No tombstone traversal**: Clean document state
- **Predictable performance**: O(1) for most local operations

### 3. **Efficient Synchronization**

- **Minimal replay**: Only divergent history portions
- **Bounded computation**: Proportional to concurrent edits, not document size
- **Smart caching**: Reuse computed states when possible

## Implementation in Loro

Loro implements Fugue (a modern CRDT algorithm) on top of Eg-Walker, combining:
- **Fugue's correctness guarantees** for text editing
- **Eg-Walker's efficiency** in storage and computation

This combination provides:
```javascript
// Simple API with powerful internals
const doc = new Loro();
const text = doc.getText("content");

// Just use indices - Eg-Walker handles the complexity
text.insert(5, "Hello");
text.delete(2, 3);

// Efficient merging happens automatically
doc.import(remoteUpdate);
```

## Garbage Collection Revolution

One of Eg-Walker's most significant advantages is **safe garbage collection**:

### Traditional CRDTs
- Must keep all tombstones forever
- Document size grows unbounded
- Complex protocols for coordinated cleanup

### With Eg-Walker
- Operations synchronized across all endpoints can be **safely removed**
- No new operations will be concurrent with fully-synchronized ones
- Document size remains proportional to **active content**

## Research Foundation

Eg-Walker is based on rigorous academic research:

> By: Joseph Gentle, Martin Kleppmann

The algorithm has been proven to:
- Maintain strong eventual consistency
- Preserve all CRDT correctness properties
- Significantly reduce computational and storage overhead

## Key Takeaways

1. **Simplicity**: Replace complex metadata with simple indices
2. **Efficiency**: Replay only what's necessary, when necessary
3. **Scalability**: Bounded storage growth with safe garbage collection
4. **Performance**: Fast local operations, efficient synchronization
5. **Innovation**: Fundamental rethinking of CRDT implementation

Eg-Walker represents a breakthrough in collaborative editing technology, making CRDTs more practical and performant for real-world applications. By cleverly leveraging the causal history already present in collaborative systems, it achieves the seemingly impossible: simpler data structures with better performance.
