# Version Vector

Version Vectors are a fundamental concept in distributed systems that track the complete state of all peers by recording how many operations each peer has contributed.

## What is a Version Vector?

A Version Vector is a map from peer IDs to operation counters, explicitly listing every peer and their operation count. It provides a complete picture of which operations are included in a version.

**Example**: `{ "peer-A": 5, "peer-B": 3 }` means this version includes operations 0-4 from peer A and operations 0-2 from peer B.

## Key Characteristics

- **Complete information**: Explicitly lists all peers and their operation counts
- **Grows with peer count**: Size increases as more peers join
- **No dependency on history**: Can determine included operations without accessing the operation log
- **Enables version comparison**: Can easily check if one version includes another

## Basic Usage

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
doc.setPeerId("1");
const text = doc.getText("content");
text.insert(0, "Hello");

// Get version vector
const vv = doc.version();
console.log(vv.toJSON()); // Map { "1" => 1 }
```

## When to Use Version Vectors

Version Vectors are ideal for:

1. **Synchronization protocols** - Determine what updates to send between peers
2. **Network communication** - Self-contained version information
3. **Distributed systems** - Track state across multiple nodes

## Comparison with Frontiers

| Aspect | Version Vectors | Frontiers |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **Size** | O(number of peers) | O(1-2) typically |
| **Information** | Complete peer states | Boundary operations only |
| **Use Case** | Synchronization | Checkpoints |
| **History Required** | No | Yes, for full information |

## Conversion with Frontiers

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const vv = doc.version();
const frontiers = doc.vvToFrontiers(vv);     // Convert to Frontiers
const backToVV = doc.frontiersToVV(frontiers); // Convert back
```
