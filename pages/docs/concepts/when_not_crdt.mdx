# When Not to Use CRDTs

CRDTs shine for collaborative editing and offline-friendly applications. 
But they are not a universal replacement for coordination, transactions, 
or authorization. Use this guide to recognize when CRDTs are a poor fit and what to use instead.

## Quick Reference

CRDTs merge; they do not reject. This clashes with requirements that demand global agreement at the time of the action:
- **Hard invariants**: Must never be violated (e.g., balance ≥ 0)
- **Exclusive ownership**: Only one winner per slot/resource

## Why CRDTs fall short here

- Merging is monotonic: remote edits cannot be “rolled back” on arrival
- No locks or transactions across replicas
- Check-then-set across peers needs coordination, not just convergence

## Common problem scenarios

### 1) Exclusive resource management

Multiple users book the same room/time concurrently.

```ts no_run
// With a CRDT-only model both intents exist after merge
// The app must pick a winner out-of-band
book("A101@2pm", { by: "A" })
book("A101@2pm", { by: "B" })
// After sync: both entries are present → invariant violated without coordination
```

Use instead:
- Transactional authority (central server or database)
- Distributed consensus (Raft/Paxos) for ownership
- Hybrid: CRDT for UI drafts, authoritative booking via server

### 2) Financial transactions

Two withdrawals race on a $100 account.

```ts no_run
// Each client applies its own withdrawal locally
withdraw(60) // A
withdraw(60) // B
// After merge, naive addition overdrafts without an authority
```

Use instead:
- ACID transactions on an authoritative store
- Command validation with a single writer per account
- Event-sourced ledger with server-side checks

### Other cases to avoid CRDT-as-the-only-source

- Uniqueness constraints (usernames, slugs, one primary per group)
- Authorization decisions that must be enforced at write time
- Global invariants (referential integrity, cross-document totals)

## When CRDTs work well

CRDTs excel when merged results are meaningful and temporary inconsistency is acceptable:

- ✅ Collaborative text, lists, maps, rich presence
- ✅ Comments, reactions, drafts, annotations
- ✅ Offline edits where convergence is enough
