# Frontiers

Frontiers are a compact way to represent document versions in Loro by identifying the "frontier" operations - the most recent operations that aren't followed by any other operations.

## What are Frontiers?

Think of Frontiers as **bookmarks in your document's history**. Instead of listing every change made by every collaborator (like Version Vectors do), Frontiers only point to the boundary operations that implicitly include all their ancestors through causal relationships.

**Analogy**: In a family tree, a Version Vector would list every family member and their generation, while Frontiers would only point to the youngest generation - everyone else is implicitly included as ancestors.

## Basic Usage

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("content");
text.insert(0, "Hello World");

// Get current frontiers (usually 1-2 elements)
const frontiers = doc.frontiers();
console.log(frontiers); // [{ peer: "...", counter: 0 }]

// Use frontiers for checkpoints
const checkpoint = doc.frontiers();
text.insert(5, " Beautiful");

// Restore to checkpoint
doc.checkout(checkpoint);
console.log(text.toString()); // Back to "Hello World"
```

## When to Use Frontiers

Frontiers are ideal for:

1. **Creating checkpoints** - Mark specific points in document history
2. **Time travel** - Navigate to exact operation points efficiently
3. **Storage optimization** - Remain compact even with many collaborators (usually 1-2 elements vs N entries in Version Vector)
4. **Recording milestones** - Save important document states

## Quick Comparison

| Aspect | Frontiers | Version Vectors |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Size** | 1-2 elements typically | Grows with peer count |
| **Use Case** | Checkpoints, time travel | Synchronization, diffing |
| **Storage** | Very compact | Larger with many peers |

## Practical Example

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const text = doc.getText("content");
const checkpoints = new Map();

// Save checkpoint with frontiers
text.insert(0, "Draft version");
checkpoints.set("draft", doc.frontiers());

// Make changes
text.delete(0, 5);
text.insert(0, "Final");
checkpoints.set("final", doc.frontiers());

// Restore to any checkpoint
doc.checkout(checkpoints.get("draft"));
console.log(text.toString()); // "Draft version"
```

## Conversion with Version Vectors

Loro allows seamless conversion between representations:

```ts twoslash
import { LoroDoc } from "loro-crdt";

const doc = new LoroDoc();
const frontiers = doc.frontiers();
const vv = doc.frontiersToVV(frontiers);        // Convert to Version Vector
const backToFrontiers = doc.vvToFrontiers(vv);  // Convert back
```
