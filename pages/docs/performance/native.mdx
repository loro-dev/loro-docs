# Native Benchmarks

[This native benchmark](https://github.com/https://twitter.com/zx_loro/crdt-bench-native) is based on
the Rust implementation of each crate.

- Conducted on a M2 Max CPU, dated 2024-10-18.
- The tasks with names starting with `automerge` use the automerge paper
  dataset.
- In this benchmark, compression is disabled for both automerge and loro.
- Diamond-type doesn't support the list type yet.
