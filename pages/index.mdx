          fullQuote="We use Loro as the document representation for our web-based computational notebook software, Latch Plots, via web-assembly. With a CRDT, we can support multiple simultaneous users without having to reinvent the wheel building custom error-prone state management systems. Multi-user interactions 'just work' in a lot of cases and, for ironing out the kinks in the rest, Loro provides state-of-the-art building blocks.\n\nCompared to other CRDT implementations, Loro better matches user expectations and feels more production-ready—the extensive documentation and blogs go into the gory technical details. When the docs are not enough, the Loro team has been fantastic in direct communication—supporting us in designing the state data model and with general issues, and taking our needs and wants into account in planning the project roadmap. \n\n This library is a great step forward toward making 'multiplayer' apps the norm, in a world where the best most users see is still the relatively primitive operational systems like in Google Docs."

          fullQuote="After extensive research, we made a big early technology bet on Loro, which we've found to have one of the most thoughtfully designed APIs that we've seen for the otherwise complex world of CRDT-related work. Our team has extensive experience in end-user computing product development, and we've found Loro to be strongly capable at solving many of the shortcomings experienced with other CRDT libraries. While the community is small, the manager of the repo has been remarkably responsive, often submitting same-day bug fixes/feature implementations to ensure that technology choice was not a bottleneck for whatever we decided to build at the product level. 10/10 experience to date."

          fullQuote="We're using Loro to make a group chat application that blurs the lines between a chat, forum, wiki, and personal notes app.\n\nWe switched to Loro after doing some benchmarking and finding that Loro could load a large document storing many IDs faster than alternatives. Loro stores the latest state of the document and then lazily loads the history if you need it, which was a perfect fit for our CRDT-to-webpage rendering needs.\n\nLoro also has some useful features like movable lists and trees which we'll need in Roomy.\n\nLoro's API is really nice to use, has excellent performance and features, and the dev team has been extremely helpful and responsive. I highly recommend!"
