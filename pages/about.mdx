# Credits

- [Ink & Switch](https://inkandswitch.com/): The principles of Local-first Software have greatly influenced this project. The [Peritext](https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/) project has also shaped our approach to rich text CRDTs.
- [Diamond-types](https://github.com/josephg/diamond-types): The ingenious OT-like merging algorithm from [@josephg](https://github.com/josephg) has been adapted to reduce the computation and space usage of CRDTs.
- [Automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge): Their use of columnar encoding for CRDTs has informed our strategies for efficient data encoding.
- [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs): We have incorporated a similar algorithm for effectively merging collaborative editing operations, thanks to their pioneering contributions.
- [Matthew Weidner](https://mattweidner.com/): His work on the [Fugue](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00583) algorithm has been invaluable, enhancing our text editing capabilities.
