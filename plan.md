# Loro Documentation Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan addresses critical gaps in Loro's documentation based on multi-stakeholder analysis. The primary issues are:
- Unclear value proposition for different user segments
- Missing "What You Can Build" concrete examples
- Technical details (WASM size, limitations) buried or outdated
- No clear decision framework for when to use/not use Loro
- Lack of progressive learning paths (quickstart → tutorial → cookbook)

## Target Audiences & Their Needs

### 1. Senior Developers
**What they seek:** Architecture details, performance benchmarks, technical trade-offs
**Current gaps:** 
- Rust + WASM implementation not mentioned on landing page
- Performance numbers buried in /docs/performance/
- No architecture diagram
- Technical advantages (Event Graph Walker, Fugue) hidden deep in docs

### 2. Collaborative App Developers  
**What they seek:** Solutions to real problems, integration examples, time-to-market
**Current gaps:**
- No clear mapping of problems → Loro solutions
- Missing complete application examples
- Unclear how much code is needed vs traditional approaches

### 3. Decision Makers
**What they seek:** Business value, implementation risk, team requirements
**Current gaps:**
- No ROI or cost-benefit analysis
- Learning curve unclear
- Migration path from competitors not documented

### 4. Problem-Oriented Users
**What they seek:** Quick answers to specific questions
**Current gaps:**
- Documentation organized by technology, not use cases
- No "How to implement X" guides
- Missing troubleshooting section

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Landing Page Enhancement (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Add "What is Loro?" Section
**Location:** Right after Hero section on index.mdx
**Content:**
```markdown
## What is Loro?

Loro is a CRDTs-based state synchronization library that makes building 
collaborative applications as simple as writing local apps. It automatically:

- **Syncs data** between users, even when offline
- **Resolves conflicts** without manual intervention  
- **Preserves history** like Git for documents
- **Works peer-to-peer** without central servers

If your app uses JSON-like data and needs any form of synchronization, 
Loro handles the complexity for you.
```

#### 1.2 Add "What You Can Build with Loro" Section
**Location:** After features on landing page
**Content:**
```markdown
## What You Can Build

### 📝 Collaborative Documents
Like Google Docs - Multiple users editing with automatic conflict resolution
→ [See Rich Text Demo](#demo) | [Tutorial](/docs/tutorial/text)

### 🎨 Design Tools
Like Figma - Real-time collaborative canvas with movable elements
→ [Tree structure](/docs/tutorial/tree) | [Movable List](/docs/tutorial/list)

### 📊 Data Dashboards
Like Airtable - Shared spreadsheets with offline support
→ [List operations](/docs/tutorial/list) | [Persistence](/docs/tutorial/persistence)

### 🎮 Multiplayer Games
Synchronized game state across players
→ [Counter for scores](/docs/tutorial/counter) | [Map for game objects](/docs/tutorial/map)

### 💬 Chat Applications
With message history and offline sync
→ [Event handling](/docs/tutorial/event) | [Time travel](/docs/tutorial/time_travel)

### 📱 Offline-First Mobile Apps
Apps that work offline and sync when connected
→ [Sync strategies](/docs/tutorial/sync) | [Encoding modes](/docs/tutorial/encoding)
```

#### 1.3 Add "Is Loro Right for You?" Decision Guide
**Location:** Before the code example on landing page
**Content:**
```markdown
## Is Loro Right for You?

### ✅ Use Loro when you need:
- Real-time collaboration without a central server
- Automatic conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- Offline editing with later synchronization
- Complete edit history and time travel
- P2P synchronization capabilities

### ⚠️ Consider alternatives when:
- You need strict business logic constraints (e.g., "only one booking per room")
- Your data doesn't fit JSON structure (e.g., binary files, media streaming)
- Simple client-server sync is sufficient (consider WebSockets)
- Bundle size is critical (<100KB requirement - Loro is ~970KB gzipped)

```

#### 1.4 Update Technical Details
**Location:** Add expandable section on landing page
**Content:**
```markdown
<details>
<summary>⚡ Technical Details</summary>

- **Language**: Rust core with WASM bindings
- **Bundle Size**: ~970KB gzipped (full CRDT implementation)
- **Performance**: 100K+ ops efficiently, see [benchmarks](/docs/performance)
- **Algorithms**: Event Graph Walker, Fugue (text), Movable Tree
- **Memory**: ~0.5-1KB per operation with history
- **Compatibility**: All modern browsers, Node.js, Swift, Python

</details>
```
